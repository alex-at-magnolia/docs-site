.Magnolia Headless

[.content]
Magnolia is the headless CMS that’s as great for content authors as it is for developers.

You’re probably choosing to go headless for a fast, productive and fun development experience and in order to have a tidy, decoupled and maintainable system. ✔️

But when you roll out your content authoring tool to your client, will they like it? Will they understand it? How much training will they need? Will they be able to manage everything themselves - not needing to come back to you on a regular basis for small changes?
